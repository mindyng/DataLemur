-- Etsy
-- This is the same question as problem #29 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!

-- You are given the two tables containing information on Etsyâ€™s user signups and purchases. Write a query to obtain the percentage of users who signed up and made a purchase within 7 days of signing up. The result should be rounded to the nearest 2 decimal places.

-- Assumptions:

-- Signups who didn't buy any products yet should also count as part of the percentage of users who signed up and made a purchase within 7 days of signing up
-- If the signup date is on 06/21/2022 and the purchase date on 06/26/2022, then the user makes up part of the percentage of users who signed up and purchased within the 7 days of signing up.
-- signups Table:
-- Column Name	Type
-- user_id	integer
-- signup_date	datetime
-- signups Example Input:
-- user_id	signup_date
-- 445	06/21/2022 12:00:00
-- 742	06/19/2022 12:00:00
-- 648	06/24/2022 12:00:00
-- 789	06/27/2022 12:00:00
-- 123	06/27/2022 12:00:00
-- user_purchases Table:
-- Column Name	Type
-- user_id	integer
-- product_id	integer
-- purchase_amount	decimal
-- purchase_date	datetime
-- user_purchases Example Input:
-- user_id	product_id	purchase_amount	purchase_date
-- 244	7575	45.00	06/22/2022 12:00:00
-- 742	1241	50.00	06/28/2022 12:00:00
-- 648	3632	55.50	06/25/2022 12:00:00
-- 123	8475	67.30	06/29/2022 12:00:00
-- 244	2341	74.10	06/30/2022 12:00:00
-- Example Output:
-- single_purchase_pct
-- 40.00
-- Explanation: The only users who purchased within 7 days of signing up are users 648 and 123. The total count of given signups is 5, resulting in a percentage of 2/5 = 40%.

--LEFT join signups to user_purchases by user_id
--CASE WHEN for purchases within 7 days of signing up
--produce ratio
--Round to 2 decimal places
